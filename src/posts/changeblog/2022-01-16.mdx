# One Clean Landing Page

### Version 1.0

When I finished Hack Reactor in early 2021, one of the biggest goals my career advisor set for me was to finish my portfolio ASAP. Nearly one year later, I'm finally starting (sorry, Kevin).

I knew building every feature I wanted, all at once, would be daunting and overwhelming. Instead, I set out to build one thing: **a clean landing page**.

## Tech Stack

There's no excuse for a minimal state page to be anything less than lightning quick, so Gatsby JS felt like the right choice. I also considered Next JS but wanted to learn something new and this was my first exposure to Gatsby.

I fired up Frontend Masters and [followed a great tutorial](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/gatsby-v2/) by Jason Lengstorf (he's a great follow on Twitter too). It's great for anyone who wants to learn the basics of Gatsby and get something running quickly.

I also didn't want to mess with a CSS framework like Boostrap so everything is vanilla with simple stylesheets and modules.

## Home

Nothing fancy here. Just a friendly greeting from your neighborhood software engineer.

In the future, the home page will list some of my favorite projects.

## Navigation

In lieu of an "About" and "Contact" page, I have links to my Github and LinkedIn (for now).

The menu bar gets a little cramped in mobile, so the links change to icons (and a "CB" for Changeblog).
