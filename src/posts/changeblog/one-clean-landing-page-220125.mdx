### Portfolio Version 1.0

When I finished Hack Reactor in early 2021, one of the biggest goals my career advisor set for me was to finish my portfolio ASAP. Nearly one year later, I'm finally starting (sorry, Kevin).

I knew building every feature I wanted, all at once, would be daunting and overwhelming. Instead, I set out to build one just one: **a clean landing page**.

## Tech Stack

There's no excuse for a minimal state page to be anything less than lightning quick, so Gatsby JS felt like the right choice. I also considered Next JS but wanted to learn something new and this was my first exposure to Gatsby.

I fired up Frontend Masters and [followed a great tutorial](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/gatsby-v2/) by Jason Lengstorf. It's great for anyone who wants to learn the basics of Gatsby and get something running quickly.

I also didn't want to mess with a CSS framework like Boostrap so everything is vanilla with simple style sheets and modules.

## Home

Nothing fancy here. Just a friendly greeting from your neighborhood software engineer.

In the future, the home page will list some of my favorite projects.

## Navigation

In lieu of an "About" and "Contact" page, I have links to my Github and LinkedIn (for now).

The menu bar gets a little cramped in mobile, so the links change to icons (and a "CB" for Changeblog).

## Changeblog

You’re reading it. Right now! Changeblog will be where I document changes and iterations to my portfolio (eventually it will be a real portfolio with all my projects) and a place to drop the occasional random thought.

## What's Next

The responsive nav bar works but it’s clunky. I want to build a hamburger button and drop down menu in raw CSS for mobile view. After that, set up my home page to actually show some projects!
